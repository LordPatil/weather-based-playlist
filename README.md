# ☀️ Weather-Based Playlist App 🎵

Welcome to the **Weather-Based Playlist App**! Ever wanted to let the weather decide what tunes you groove to? Well, now you can!

## 🌦️ How It Works

1. **Check the Weather:** Our app uses fancy weather magic (a.k.a. APIs) to figure out if it’s sunny, rainy, snowy, or just plain weird outside.
2. **Pick the Perfect Playlist:** Based on the weather, we whip up the most fitting Spotify playlist. Feeling sunny? Get ready for some upbeat jams. Snowed in? Cozy up with some chill vibes.
3. **Enjoy the Music:** Hit play and let the weather set the mood!

## 🎉 Features

- **Sunny Days:** Bright and cheery tunes to match those sunny rays.
- **Rainy Days:** Soothing tracks to make rainy days feel cozier.
- **Snowy Days:** Winter wonderland music to complement the snowflakes.
- **Random Days:** Because some days are just plain random, and so is the playlist!
